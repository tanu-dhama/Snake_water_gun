# Snake_water_gun
Project Title: Snake_Water_Gun_Python
Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to create a simple, interactive command-line game of Snake, Water, Gun using Python. This project helps beginners understand basic programming concepts such as conditional logic, loops, user input handling, and randomization. It’s an engaging way to practice core Python skills through game development.
Description:

Snake_Water_Gun_Python is a classic Python-based game modeled after the traditional Indian variation of Rock-Paper-Scissors. The game allows a user to play against the computer, where each round both players (user and computer) choose between "Snake," "Water," or "Gun." The winner is decided based on predefined rules:

    Snake drinks water → Snake wins

    Gun shoots snake → Gun wins

    Water douses gun → Water wins

The project uses the random module to simulate the computer’s choice and basic if-else logic to determine the outcome. The program keeps track of rounds, scores, and declares the final winner. It is ideal for Python beginners looking to build simple terminal-based applications and improve logical thinking.
